     <p style="color:white; text-align:justify;"><font size="2">As person passionate about architecture and obsessed in what makes the definition of a "home," one of my personal biggest goals when creating anything is to make sure that the user experiences comfort, familiarity, and ease like what a "home" should feel like. Whether designing and creating a mobile application, website, programs, etc... this is a ubiquitous term at hand and can be attached to any product that delivers to consumers.<br>Although here, there might be only aesthetic principles at mind in reading so far, but a home should feel efficient, so that the user draws in trust and comfort. This means that not only there is a big emphasis on front end development, but just as a large willingness and eagerness for the greatest back end development as well.<br>The term "home" is not a concrete definition as this term means something different to everyone personally; my objective is not only the application of applying home in whatever I build, but also learn what home means to other people, thus always building an open, dynamic, and diverse palate of what home means in the digital age, where people may feel overwhelmed at massive amounts of information, which they may feel homeless.<br>If whatever you build does not seem like home, how will people use something that is not inviting and time consuming to understand to begin with?</font></p>
